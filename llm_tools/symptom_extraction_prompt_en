**Prompt:**
Analyze the following tweet-like message to determine if it describes the user's own influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI is defined by:
- Fever ≥38°C (100°F) **AND**
- At least one respiratory symptom (cough or sore throat) **PLUS**
- Additional systemic symptoms (headache, muscle aches, chills, fatigue, nasal congestion)

**Instructions:**
1. First, determine if the message is about the user's personal experience:
   - Look for first-person pronouns (I, me, my) or direct references to self
   - Exclude messages about others' illnesses or general health information

2. If it's about the user's own experience, classify as "ILI-Related" if all three conditions are met:
   - Explicit or implicit fever indication
   - Presence of cough/sore throat
   - ≥1 systemic symptom from list above

3. Classify as "Non-ILI" if:
   - Not about user's personal experience
   - No fever context
   - Symptoms better explained by other conditions (e.g., allergies, COVID-19 specific terms)
   - Mentions vaccines without symptom reporting

4. For ILI-Related messages:
   - Extract symptoms using exact wording from text
   - Note symptom duration if mentioned
   - Flag severity indicators: "difficulty breathing", "chest pain", "persistent vomiting"

**Response Format:**
{
  "PersonalExperience": "[Yes/No]",
  "Classification": "[ILI-Related/Non-ILI]",
  "Symptoms": ["symptom1", "symptom2", ...],
  "Duration": "[if specified]",
  "SeverityFlags": ["flag1", ...]
}

**Example Message 1:** "I've been down with a 102°F fever, nasty cough, and body aches for 2 days now. This flu is brutal!"
**Example Output 1:** 
{
  "PersonalExperience": "Yes",
  "Classification": "ILI-Related",
  "Symptoms": ["102°F fever", "nasty cough", "body aches"],
  "Duration": "2 days",
  "SeverityFlags": []
}

**Example Message 2:** "CDC reports flu cases are on the rise. Remember to get your flu shot!"
**Example Output 2:** 
{
  "PersonalExperience": "No",
  "Classification": "Non-ILI",
  "Symptoms": [],
  "Duration": "",
  "SeverityFlags": []
}
